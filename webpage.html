        <div id="about">
            <p>Hi! My name is Anna Morris and I am 22 years old. I was born in 
                Russia and moved to Renton, Washington after I was adopted
                at the age of four and a half. I have two younger siblings 
                who are biologically related to me and who are also a part 
                of my adopted family. My passions include dance, music, travel, 
                and eating great foods. I am a soon-to-be graduate at the 
                University of Washington where I studied Political Science. 
                Funnily enough, I am actually pursuing a career in advertising,
                which is not necessarily related to my degree. When I ask other 
                people to describe me as a person, they often say that I am driven, 
                creative, artistic, funny, passionate, and always ready for adventures 
                and challenges.
            </p>
